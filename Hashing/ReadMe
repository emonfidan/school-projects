1.Test cases should be run like this(redirect your screen output to a file like below):

./subtask1 log1.txt output1.txt
./subtask2 log2.txt output2.txt
./subtask3 log3.txt output3.txt
./subtask3 log4.txt output4.txt

To test:
1.Copy the test*.cpp and the Makefile in your directory
(Must not be the same one where you have your codes and own Makefile, also copy your output*.txt files there)
2.Modify the Makefile by including the path of your cloned google test directory
3.make build
4.make run
