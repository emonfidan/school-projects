1.Test cases should be run like this(redirect your screen output to a file like below):

./pathFinder input1.txt 0 6 > output1.txt
./pathFinder input2.txt 7 31 > output2.txt
./pathFinder input3.txt 514 716 > output3.txt
./pathFinder input4.txt 14 77 > output4.txt
./pathFinder input5.txt 14 77 > output5.txt

To test:
1.Copy the test*.cpp and the Makefile in your directory
(Must not be the same one where you have your codes and own Makefile, also copy your output*.txt files there)
2.Modify the Makefile by including the path of your cloned google test directory
3.make build
4.make run
